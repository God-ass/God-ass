Hello World! 🌍 I’m JJ, your friendly neighborhood coder. You’ve probably never heard of me, and that’s okay - I’m the best-kept secret in the programming world. 😎

Usually, READMEs are for software and applications, but here I am, breaking the norms and writing a README for myself. 💻

So go ahead, read all about me. But fair warning - once you start, you might not be able to stop. 😳

Oh, and about that Star button ⭐ - You can click it all you want, but it won’t do anything. Consider it a metaphor for life’s futile pursuits… or just a bug in the system. 🐞

Happy coding! 🚀
